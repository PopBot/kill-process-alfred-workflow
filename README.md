# Kill Process Alfred Workflow

<small><b>Version 1.0.0.</b></small>

Alfred Workflow to Kill Process given a string name

![Preview](./preview.png)

This Alfred workflow takes a string and searches the currently active processes for the name. It retrieves the corresponding **PID** for the process and kills it.

This workflow is case-insensitive

Usage:

- `kill <process-name>`
- `kill pycharm`	- Kills PyCharm Professional
- `kill XCode` - Kills Xcode
- `kil saf` - Kills Safari


Feel free to modify this Workflow in the future 💪🏼
